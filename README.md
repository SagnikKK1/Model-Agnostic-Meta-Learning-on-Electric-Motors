# Galileo Ferraris Contest: Data-Driven Traction Motor Design

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to the **Galileo Ferraris Contest**, where participants leverage data-driven methodologies to analyze and model traction motors. The contest emphasizes the challenges of **multi-physical** interactions in motor design, requiring advanced techniques to optimize performance while balancing contrasting constraints.

## Context
Traction motors present a **complex design challenge** due to their **multi-physical** nature, involving interactions across multiple domains:
- **Electromagnetic**
- **Thermal**
- **Structural**
- **Acoustic**

These interactions impose **demanding constraints**, making traditional design approaches less effective. Instead, **data-driven pre-design tools** become crucial for efficient modeling and optimization.

### Key Challenges
1. **Contrasting Design Criteria**: Multiple factors must be considered in the design process, often competing against each other:
   - **Torque vs. Temperature**
   - **Rotating Speed vs. Mechanical Stresses**
   - Other domain-specific trade-offs

2. **Need for a Multi-Physical Approach**: Since different physics-based interactions influence performance, an integrated modeling strategy is necessary.

3. **Optimization for Performance**: A Pareto-optimal approach is needed to **balance trade-offs** and ensure an efficient motor design under varying constraints.

## Data-Driven Approach
Given these challenges, we explore the application of **machine learning and optimization techniques** to predict motor performance across different operating conditions. Potential approaches include:
- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for incorporating physical constraints into learning.
- **Meta-Learning (MAML)** to generalize across different motor datasets.
- **Surrogate Modeling** for rapid evaluation of motor designs.
- **Uncertainty Quantification** to assess reliability.

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains training and test datasets for different motor types.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and model development.

## Goals
- Develop **accurate predictive models** for traction motor performance.
- Identify **optimal design trade-offs** using data-driven methods.
- Contribute to the advancement of **multi-physics simulation and modeling**.
